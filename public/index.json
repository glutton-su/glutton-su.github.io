Then after some messing around I found we can add another parameter in burp request. also we have to change our email and password while sending the request. These will be our creds to login as subscribed user.\nGetting shell # This is what we see when login. There is a file upload but it strips the extension and uploads it. while going to the file path it is downloaded to the system.\nNow let’s try getting it local host files.\nIt works!! BUT idk if it will give me anything outside /var\nSINCE, this is rabbit mq, maybe there is an admin port in the localhost of the machine?? Let’s try.\nLooks like it works.\nLooking at this result, I didn’t find anything interesting so, I fuzzed /api endpoint.\nAfter fuzzing for /api endpoints i found a /api/docs endpoint which then uploaded gave a interesting endpoint of an chatbot\nAfter catching the request for chatbot, i messed around a bit but could not find anything. After I received a hint that there was either XSS or SSTI, I realized there was no XSS so I then searched for SSTI exploit payloads. A simple payload, if I were to put some values between two curly brackets like so {{7*3}} it’s result would be printed in the response. This worked, which meant I could insert a payload to gain a reverse shell. As I had no experience in exploiting SSTI, I asked the almighty ChatGPT for help. It generated me a payload which I inserted in the username parameter.\nPrivilege Escalation # With a linpeas scan I found a directory called rabbitmq. When I listed all files I found a cookie file. This could mean we have a exploit using this cookie??\nSearching for erlang in metasploit we do get a cookie reverse shell exploit. BUT this wasn’t working on my machine because my metasploit was recently updated, so I had to use TryHackMe attackbox. After gaining a shell of rabbitmq from metasploit, I ran a python3 reverse shell and got the shell in my machine.\nRemember how we got index.html of the admin port through localhost? We are going to forward that port to our localhost so that we can access the admin page. For this i used chisel and forwarded the port.\nThe default credentials were not working, digging around in official documentation of rabbitmq, we need to make the user with admin permission ourselves then we can access the page. So, I again closed the chisel server-client i was running and created the user called admin in the rabbitmq’s shell and again ran chisel.\nIT WORKED!!\nLooking around, I find a interesting file and downloaded it.\nTurns out this contains hashes, what a luck right? NOOOO\nI spent more than 5 hours trying to crack it but no use. THIS WAS A RABBIT HOLE.\nAfter many trials and errors we found the password for root, the password seems to be the hash it self.\n","date":"22 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/rabbitstr/","section":"Writeups","summary":"Rabbit Store # Enumeration # For port enumeration, I started with rustscan and then did a detailed scan with nmap.","title":"Rabbit Store","type":"text"},{"content":"","date":"22 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"TryHackMe","type":"list"},{"content":"A stash of write-ups dissecting challenges, exploits, and machines—sorted by the platforms they were dropped on.\n","date":"22 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/","section":"Writeups","summary":"A stash of write-ups dissecting challenges, exploits, and machines—sorted by the platforms they were dropped on.","title":"Writeups","type":"list"},{"content":"","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/ctfs/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"CTFs","type":"list"},{"content":"","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/hackthebox/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"HackTheBox","type":"list"},{"content":" SOFTWARICA HACKFEST 2025 Jan 03 Writeup by Team TkNB@Nepal # Challenge name: Happy Holi! # Category: Misc # This challenge provided an image file which had various color combination.\nIn dcode.fr we have a tool called cipher identifier.

It was v 2.4.41 which tried to search for exploits but couldn’t find.\nthen I used hydra tool to gain the password\nhydra -l admin -P ~/Downloads/rockyou.txt lookup.thm http-post-form \u0026quot;/login.php:username=^USER^\u0026amp;password=^PASS^:Wrong password.

But we have a user “think”. Then i tried to gather more info from this site and i found this\ni searchsploit elfinder and i found its vunlerabilities\nthen i ran metasploit and searched for it: search elfinder 2.1.48 and got one exploit. i used it and after setting some options i ran it and gained a meterpreter shell\nhere the rhosts should have been files.lookup.thm, which i later corrected and it returned a meterpreter shell. after i got the shell i ran a few commands, we were logged in as www-data. so i looked up how can i escalate my privileges to that of a user. we already have a user called ‘think’, so my first thought was to check for login creds. I ran a find command to search for files with perms 4000\nfind / -perm /4000 2\u0026gt;/dev/null\nhere, the interesting one was /usr/sbin/pwm when i tried to run it, it was searching for .passwords file.\nthen i went on to /tmp directory as it is worldwritable. i created a file named id there. echo -e '#!/bin/bash\\n echo \u0026quot;uid=33(think) gid=33(think) groups=33(think)\u0026quot;' \u0026gt; id\nalso make id an executable file chmod +x id\nthen i ran the /pwm again and got a list of passwords which I saved to a file in my machine. After which i started hydra to bruteforce ssh of ‘think’ user.\nI successfully got the ssh password and logged in.\nthe user flag was just one ls away. following to it I searched for something i could use without root permissions. sudo -l\ndoing this i found look so i went to gtfobins and there it was\nwhat we need is the third one\nLFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa sudo look \u0026#39;\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$LFILE\u0026#34; this gives us direct access to .ssh file of root and displays the id_rsa\nI saved this to my machine and gave it perms 600 and sshed to root\nthen root flag is found with just ls\n","date":"27 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/lookup/","section":"Writeups","summary":"after gaining the ip of machine i quickly started nmap scan","title":"Lookup","type":"text"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/example/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Example","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"projects","summary":"","title":"projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" I am Subeg Suwal(glutton) # Hi, I’m Subeg Suwal, a passionate cybersecurity student currently pursuing a BSc.
