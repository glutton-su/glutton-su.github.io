It was v 2.4.41 which tried to search for exploits but couldn’t find.\nthen I used hydra tool to gain the password\nhydra -l admin -P ~/Downloads/rockyou.txt lookup.thm http-post-form \u0026quot;/login.php:username=^USER^\u0026amp;password=^PASS^:Wrong password. Please try again.\u0026quot;\nhere, hydra will put up a http-post request, the ‘^USER^’ will be replaced by admin and ‘^PASS^’ will be replaced by rockyou.txt. hydra will then check if the combination returns wrong password, if it doesn’t then it will return us the password\nand i got a password.\ni tried logging in with this but still couldn’t get in. so i tried to find the username for obtained password. i found about login.php from its source code.\nthen i got a username jose\nwith this we can log in to the website.\nand we are redirected to files.lookup.thm which we need to add to our hosts file to access\nwe have two files without locks so i opened them up test file was empty but creds file had smth\nI thought maybe this is ssh login pass but seems like i fell to a rabbit-hole. But we have a user “think”. Then i tried to gather more info from this site and i found this\ni searchsploit elfinder and i found its vunlerabilities\nthen i ran metasploit and searched for it: search elfinder 2.1.48 and got one exploit. i used it and after setting some options i ran it and gained a meterpreter shell\nhere the rhosts should have been files.lookup.thm, which i later corrected and it returned a meterpreter shell. after i got the shell i ran a few commands, we were logged in as www-data. so i looked up how can i escalate my privileges to that of a user. we already have a user called ‘think’, so my first thought was to check for login creds. I ran a find command to search for files with perms 4000\nfind / -perm /4000 2\u0026gt;/dev/null\nhere, the interesting one was /usr/sbin/pwm when i tried to run it, it was searching for .passwords file.\nthen i went on to /tmp directory as it is worldwritable. i created a file named id there. echo -e '#!/bin/bash\\n echo \u0026quot;uid=33(think) gid=33(think) groups=33(think)\u0026quot;' \u0026gt; id\nalso make id an executable file chmod +x id\nthen i ran the /pwm again and got a list of passwords which I saved to a file in my machine. After which i started hydra to bruteforce ssh of ‘think’ user.\nI successfully got the ssh password and logged in.\nthe user flag was just one ls away. following to it I searched for something i could use without root permissions. sudo -l\ndoing this i found look so i went to gtfobins and there it was\nwhat we need is the third one\nLFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa sudo look \u0026#39;\u0026#39; \u0026#34;$LFILE\u0026#34; this gives us direct access to .ssh file of root and displays the id_rsa\nI saved this to my machine and gave it perms 600 and sshed to root\nthen root flag is found with just ls\n","date":"27 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/lookup/","section":"Writeups","summary":"after gaining the ip of machine i quickly started nmap scan","title":"Lookup","type":"text"},{"content":"","date":"27 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"TryHackMe","type":"list"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/example/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Example","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"projects","summary":"","title":"projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Subeg Suwal # Hi, I’m Subeg Suwal, a passionate cybersecurity student currently pursuing a BSc.
